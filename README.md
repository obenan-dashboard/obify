**Enterprise-grade AI model comparison platform for review analysis**

</div>

## üìã Overview

Obify is a powerful platform that enables enterprises to systematically compare the performance, cost, and quality of multiple AI language models for review processing and text analysis. With Obify, you can make data-driven decisions about which AI models best fit your specific use cases.

### üé¨ Demo

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- API keys for the models you want to test (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and/or Google Gemini)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/obenan-dashboard/obify.git
   cd obify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure API keys**:
   
   Create a `config.json` file in the root directory with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "api_keys": {
       "openai": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       "anthropic": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
       "google": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
     },
     "note": ""
   }
   ```
   
   > **Note:** Replace the placeholders with your actual API keys. The config.json file is included in .gitignore to prevent accidental commits of your API keys.

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**:
   
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5005`

## üìä Usage

1. **Upload Data**: On the home page, upload your CSV, TXT, or Excel file containing reviews
2. **Select Review Column**: If multiple columns are detected, you'll be prompted to select which one contains review text
3. **Configure Test**: Choose which models to compare, set your prompt template, and start the analysis
4. **View Results**: Explore comparative performance metrics, sample responses, and interactive charts
5. **Export Report**: Generate PDF or download complete results for reporting and sharing

## üîß Extending Obify

Obify is designed to be easily extended with new models and providers. You can:

- Add support for new models from existing providers
- Update pricing information
- Implement new pricing structures
- Add entirely new providers

### How to Add a New Model

To add a new model, edit the `utils/model_config.py` file. This centralized config file contains all model definitions and pricing information. For example:

```python
# Add a new model to an existing provider
OPENAI_MODELS["new-model-name"] = {
    "name": "New Model Display Name",
    "input_price": 0.000XX,  # per token price
    "output_price": 0.000XX, # per token price
    "icon": "bi-robot"       # Bootstrap icon class
}
```

See the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING_MODELS.md) for detailed instructions on extending model support.

## Pricing and Cost Calculation

Obify accurately calculates costs using the following formula:
```
Total Cost = (Input Tokens / 1,000,000 √ó Input Cost per 1M Tokens) + (Output Tokens / 1,000,000 √ó Output Cost per 1M Tokens)
```

The application includes up-to-date pricing for all supported models, ensuring that cost calculations are accurate. Special handling is included for tiered pricing models (like Gemini 2.5 Pro).

### Centralized Model Configuration

All model definitions, pricing information, and calculation formulas are centralized in a single file (`utils/model_config.py`), making it easy to:
- Add new models
- Update pricing for existing models
- Implement new pricing structures
- Add entirely new providers

See the [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING_MODELS.md) for details on how to extend the model support.

## Installation

           "anthropic": "your-anthropic-api-key",
           "google": "your-gemini-api-key"
       },
       "note": ""
   }
   ```
   
   Alternatively, you can set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"
   export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Access the web interface**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage Guide

1. **Upload Dataset**: Start by uploading a CSV, TXT, or Excel file containing reviews or text to be processed
2. **Select Column**: If your file has multiple columns, select which column contains the reviews to analyze
3. **Select Models**: Choose one or more AI models to evaluate
4. **Configure Prompt**: Customize the prompt template that will be sent to the models
5. **Run Analysis**: Process your data through the selected models
6. **Review Results**: Examine the generated report with performance metrics and visualizations

## Contributing

Obify is designed to be easily extensible. To contribute:
